Easily generate Terms of Service and a Privacy Policy for your site.

== Description ==

You can hire a lawyer and pay a lot of money to get Terms of Service and a Privacy Policy for your site.  Good product, but very expensive.

Or you can cut and paste the terms from some other web site.  But who knows if those terms have anything to do with what happens on your site.  The wrong terms can be worse than none at all.  And it might be copyright infringement.

Instead, use Legull.  Spend about five minutes answering some simple questions about your site, hit the button, and you have your terms.  If you need to fine-tune them, or have a lawyer help with that, go ahead. Once generated, the Legull terms are fully editable.  And when you change your site, you can update your answers to the Legull Q&A and re-publish your new terms.

Now with support for Gravity Forms! Adding 3 new advanced fields to give your users ways to accept your site's terms of service prior to form submission. Compatible with Gravity Forms up through version 1.9.

Developers:  Solve your clientsâ€™ problem without playing lawyer.  Give them Legull, and give them an easy and affordable solution to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy dilemmas.  Developer or per-site licensing is available for our add-on packs, to use with your sites that have e-commerce, social, digital downloads, and other functions.
